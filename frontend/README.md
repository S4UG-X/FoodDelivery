# Starting
can you write what i just did in this workspace so that i can read it in for the future use.


You created a React frontend project, set up a basic App component that renders a Navbar component, 
and configured the project structure. You also updated .gitignore to exclude environment and node_modules files.
Also i imported tailwind css.
