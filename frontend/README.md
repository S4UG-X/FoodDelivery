# Starting
can you write what i just did in this workspace so that i can read it in for the future use.


You created a React frontend project, set up a basic App component that renders a Navbar component, 
and configured the project structure. You also updated .gitignore to exclude environment and node_modules files.
Also i imported tailwind css.


# Navbar
created the navbar, first styled the middle then the right


# Cart

for that learn react route: to go to different pages/components without reloding the page

# Header file
create the header file. 

# Menu section

we created the basic menu and 
then Now we are going to make this: when we click on the menu items then that menu will be bordered-red.
