React Router is used to enable navigation between different pages or components in a React app without reloading the page, 
allowing for a seamless single-page application (SPA) experience.

so for that npm i react-router-dom 
 
 Then in main.jsx, we do this in main.jsx so that whole react app can use routing.

 //createBrowserRouter is used to define and configure routes in React Router v6+, enabling you to map URL paths to React components for client-side navigation in a single-page application.
 //RouterProvider is used to supply your router configuration (created with createBrowserRouter) to your React app, enabling navigation and route matching. It must wrap your app to activate routing.
 
 import  {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider} from 'react-router-dom'

 Then in the same file

 const router = ()=>{[
     {
        path: "/",
        element: <Home/>  //this is the component that you have to import first in this same file.

     },
    {}
 ] 
 }
 return (

    <RouterProvider router={router}/>
 )
//import the Navbar here in App.jsx


in Navbar.jsx

instead of using anchor tag, use

import { Link } from "react-router-dom";


<Link to="/home"> <li> Home</li> </Link>
<Link to="/about"> <li> About</li> </Link>


Now for the params in the href like  "/user/:userId"

then go to User.jsx
 there 
 import {useParams} from "react-router-dom"


 then you do 
 const params = useParams()

 return(
    {params.username}
 )
